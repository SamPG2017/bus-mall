=============================================================

Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

Marketing Research Team:

As the marketing director, I need a quick way to tell which products have 
the most number of clicks.
As the marketing director, I need to be able to show my boss a chart that summarizes those results.
As the marketing director, I want this information in an organized container and I prefer a chart format.
As a designer, I want the page displayed using the style sheet it took me 3 years to fully create - fonts, colors, and general "feel".
As the market research analyst, I want to understand what might drive customers to purchase products in the future.


Developer:
** wants to write elegant and DRY code
** wants to provide functionality in the form of logic to end up with accurate information
** wants to give a clear path to anyone who needs to follow code in the future when s/he is promoted to Senior developer !
** wants to have no conflict with the marketing director re: styles so that s/he is hired for the next project.

Focus Group Participant:  
** wants a neatly organized page so that it's clear what is being asked
** wants to click through the products as quickly as possible so that s/he collects his/her $10 bucks and/or gets done with his/her community service requirement for college admission
** wants to have to go through as few iterations as possible because clicking through this stuff is fairly boring, except when UNICORN MEAT shows up in the list.
** wants to see clear and easy-to-see images of all the products each iteration
