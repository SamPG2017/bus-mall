user_stories.md: Express your stories in story language (as a so and so I need a thingamabob so that I can do stuff with it)

=============================================================

Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

Marketing Research Team:

As the marketing director, I need a quick way to tell which products have 
the most number of clicks.
As the marketing director, I want this information displayed to me in an easy-to-read format -- like a chart.   
As the designer, I want the page displayed using the style sheet it took me 3 years to completely style - fonts, colors, and general "feel".
As the marketing research analyst, I want better insight into what my customer might want to see in future product offerings. 
As the product manager, I want to drive customers to purchase products in the future.
As the sales director working with the marketing team, I want the customer to have an easy way to click through to get to an order form and shopping cart.

Developer:
As a developer, I want to write elegant and DRY code.
As a developer, I want to provide functionality in the form of logic to end up with accurate information.
As a developer, I want to give a clear path in the form of useful comments to anyone who needs to follow code in the future when I am promoted.
As a developer, I want to have no conflict with the marketing director re: styles so that I can be hired for the next project.

Focus Group Participant:  
As a focus group participant, I want a neatly organized page so that it's clear what is being asked of me.
As a focus group participant, I want to click through the products as quickly as possible so that I can collect my $10 bucks and/or get done with this community service requirement for college admission.
As a focus group participant, I want to have to go through as few iterations as possible because clicking through this stuff is fairly boring, except when UNICORN MEAT shows up in the list.
As a focus group participant, I want to see clear and easy-to-see images of all the products each iteration.
As a focus group participant, I want everything to work the very first time.  If the page errors out, I will not be happy.
