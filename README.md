# bus-mall

This is a proprietary app created for BusMall.  It takes user input in the form of clicking on images provided (25 in all) to get a total of how many clicks per image.  A chart, located below the clickable images, displays results after a user has clicked on an image 25 times and shows how many times each image was clicked, per image.

He says on the page referenced above "If you want to use my reset styles, then feel free! It's all explicitly in the public domain" -- so I did.  Thanks, Eric !
